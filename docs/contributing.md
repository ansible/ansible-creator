# Contributing to ansible-creator

To actively contribute to the development and enhancement of ansible-creator,
your participation is valued. Please use pull requests on a branch of your own
fork. After
[creating your fork on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects),
you can do:

```console
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:your-name/ansible-creator
$ cd ansible-creator
$ git checkout -b your-branch-name

# DO SOME CODING HERE

$ git add your new files
$ git commit -v
$ git push origin your-branch-name
```

You will then be able to create a pull request from your commit. This will
initiate the process of reviewing and merging your contributions.

For contributions affecting core functionality (i.e., anything except docs or
examples), ensure to include corresponding tests that validate the changes. Even
if you're not providing a code fix, your input is valuableâ€”feel free to raise
[issues](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-creator/issues) in the repository.

## Standards

All pull requests undergo automated tests. To ensure that your changes align
with project standards, run checks locally before pushing commits using
[tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/).
