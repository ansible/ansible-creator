# Agents.md

`ansible-creator init` will be creating an `AGENTS.md` file when creating new
projects of type `collection` or `project`. This file will instruct AI agents
to follow our good practices by pointing it to a web address with the last
version of our Agent instructions.

As a user you can also add your own custom instructions there.

Because we do expect to change the instructions quite often, these are not
included inside the package.

Current content of the AGENTS.md file is:

```md
{!agents.md!}
```
